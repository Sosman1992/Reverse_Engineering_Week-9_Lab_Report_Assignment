# Binary Reverse Engineering with Crackmes

The Weeks Lab focus was on Binary Reverse Engineering with crackmes which involves running the crackmes with tools including but not limited to (strings, uftrace) at the terminal, Ghidra- a reverse engineering tool that was developed by the NSA for debugging crackmes etc. to enable in finding of essential information from the crackme basically a PASSWORD.

# SOLUTION TO Lab 9-1 [easy_crackme_1] crackme AND EXPLANATION OF HOW I SOLVE IT USING THE TOOLS (strings,uftrace,ghidra) 
## STEPS
After downloading the file from the website, I extracted the downloaded zip file `ezcrackme1` to my Desktop and it provided with a file named `easy_crackme_1`. I proceeded by running the file `easy_crackme_1` in my linux terminal using `file command` to ascertain the type of file; from the output it showed that `easy_crackme_1` is 64-Bit Executable Linux file with a BuildID[sha1]=e098404e1e1cee54cad0e7ad48d2850490b71da7. From the terminal I runned the command `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_1` to enable me gain more valuable insights into its behavior and performance, which can help me identify the password of this crackme. I then went on to run `strings` command on this executable to see the printable strings contained within this binary and I found out some interesting  strings including but not limited: `picklecucumberl337`, `Please insert the password:`,`First Password: `,`Your password <%s> was incorrect. Time for some more RE...`,`You cracked me! Now make a keygen!`. With these strings, I guessed the string `picklecucumberl337` might be the password for this crackme. I rerun the command `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_1` on my terminal and when it executed it printed the string 'please insert the password:' and upon typying the string `picklecucumberl337` it outputs the success message `You cracked me! Now make a keygen!`, hence the password was correctly entered.
 
## ANSWER
In conclusion `picklecucumberl337` is the password for `easy_crackme_1`, because it is the string that will make the logic statement `strcmp(" ", "picklecucumberl337")` true whenever the strcmp function is called to make comparison of the string entered by the user when prompted to enter the password  within the main function of the program. 


# SOLUTION TO Lab 9-2 [easy_crackme_2] crackme AND EXPLANATION OF HOW I SOLVE IT USING THE TOOLS (strings,uftrace,ghidra) 
## STEPS
After downloading the file from the website, I extracted the downloaded zip file `ezcrackme2` to my Desktop and it provided with a file named `easy_crackme_2`. I proceeded by running the file `easy_crackme_2` in my linux terminal using `file command` to ascertain the type of file; from the output it showed that `easy_crackme_2` is 64-Bit Executable Linux file with a BuildID[sha1]=4ad617747df6c308470f3aa36589cad35e02d5f3. From the terminal I runned the command `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_2` to enable me gain more valuable insights into its behavior and performance, which can help me identify the password of this crackme. I then went on to run `strings` command on this executable to see the printable strings contained within this binary and I found out some interesting  strings including but not limited: `artificialtree`, `Please insert the password:`,`First Password: `,`Your password <%s> was incorrect. Time for some more RE...`,`You cracked me! Now make a keygen!`. With these strings, I guessed the string `artificialtree` might be the password for this crackme. I rerun the command `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_2` on my terminal and when it executed it printed the string 'please insert the password:' and upon typying the string `artificialtree` it outputs the success message `You cracked me! Now make a keygen!`, hence the password was correctly entered.
 
## ANSWER
In conclusion `artificialtree` is the password for `easy_crackme_2`, because it is the string that will make the logic statement `strcmp("", "artificialtree")` true whenever the strcmp function is called to make comparison of the strings entered by the user within the main function of the program.



# SOLUTION TO Lab 9-3 [easy_crackme_3] crackme AND EXPLANATION OF HOW I SOLVE IT USING THE TOOLS (strings,uftrace,ghidra) 
## STEPS
After downloading the file from the website, I extracted the downloaded zip file `ezcrackme3` to my Desktop and it provided with a file named `easy_crackme_3`. I proceeded by running the file `easy_crackme_3` in my linux terminal using `file command` to ascertain the type of file; from the output it showed that `easy_crackme_1` is 64-Bit Executable Linux file with a BuildID[sha1]=1c3d5fd32bfc3026c67c6fa59315e872b61e6d8b. From the terminal I runned the command `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_3` to enable me gain more valuable insights into its behavior and performance, which can help me identify the password of this crackme. I then went on to run `strings` command on this executable to see the printable strings contained within this binary and I found out some interesting  strings including but not limited: `strawberry`,`kiwi`,`Please insert the password:`,`Password:`,`You cracked me!`,`Your password <%s> was incorrect. Time for some more RE...`,`Now make a keygen!.` With these strings, I guessed the string `strawberry` or `kiwi` might be the password for this crackme. I rerun the command `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_3` on my terminal and when it executed it printed the string 'please insert the password:' and upon typing the string `strawberry` it outputs the unsuccessful message `Your password <strawberry> was incorrect. Time for some more RE...`, hence the password for this crackme was not strawberry as I assumed. Furthermore, I also assumed the password for this crackme might be `kiwi`, hence went on to rerun `uftrace -a ./easy_crackme_3` again and supplied the password kiwi when prompted to insert the password and upon typing the string `kiwi` it outputs the unsuccessful message `Your password <kiwi> was incorrect. Time for some more RE...`, therefore the password for this crackme was also not kiwi as I assumed. 
 
## ANSWER
In conclusion `strawberrykiwi` is the password for `easy_crackme_1`, because it is the string that will make the logic statement `strcmp(" ", "picklecucumberl337")` true whenever the strcmp function is called to make comparison of the string entered by the user when prompted to enter the password  within the main function of the program.
